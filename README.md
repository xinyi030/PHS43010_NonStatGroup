# Bayesian Inference Clinical Trials and Nonparametric Models

This repository contains the final project for our graduate-level class in Bayesian modeling and inference. The project involves the implementation of a logistic regression model, simulation studies, and performance analysis in the context of clinical trials.

## Team

- Captain: Zhang, Xinyi
- Members: ...

## Task Overview
Our main tasks involve:

1. Reviewing a paper on CRM design for phase I dose-finding trials.
2. Reproducing results in specific figures by fitting a logistic regression model.
3. Running simulation studies using the CRM with logistic regression.
4. Answering specified research questions.
5. Writing a report and compiling our work in an R Markdown document.
6. Presentation

Detailed task, assignees, and progress can be tracked under the "Projects" tab in our GitHub repository.



## Project Structure

- `Non_Stat.Rmd`: R Markdown document containing the full report for the project, including the review, model reproduction, simulation studies, and answers to the questions.

## Instructions

To run the R Markdown document, you need to have R installed on your computer along with the necessary packages (listed at the start of the `my_report.Rmd` file). Once you have these, you can open `my_report.Rmd` in RStudio and click the "Knit" button to generate the report.

## Collaborating with GitHub

Here are the steps to collaborate on this project using GitHub:

1. **Clone the Repository**: If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by using the command `git clone [repository URL]` in your terminal or command prompt.

2. **Pull Latest Changes**: Before you start making changes, always pull the latest version of the repository. You can do this with the command `git pull origin master`.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Open the `my_report.Rmd` file in RStudio and make your changes. Remember to save your work regularly.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you're done with your changes, you need to commit them. You can do this with the command `git commit -a -m "[Your Commit Message]"`. Replace `[Your Commit Message]` with a brief description of the changes you made.

5. **Push Your Changes**: After committing your changes, you need to push them to the repository. You can do this with the command `git push origin master`.

6. **Resolve Any Conflicts**: If someone else has made changes to the same sections of the `NonStat.Rmd` file, there may be conflicts when you try to push your changes. If this happens, Git will give you instructions on how to resolve the conflicts.

Please remember to always pull the latest changes before you start working and to commit and push your changes regularly.
